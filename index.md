## About

Group 16 is a team of five students collaborating on their Capstone Senior Design project at the University of South Carolina. United by the shared frustrations of navigating Blackboard, we set out to create a web application that streamlines a studentâ€™s academic life. Our platform integrates course data, assignments, exams, and more into a centralized, intuitive interface designed to boost organization and reduce stress. We hope this tool serves as a helpful resource for future students on their academic journey.

## Link To Repo

[github.com/SCCapstone/Group16](https://github.com/SCCapstone/Group16)

## External Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need to install Node.js, the Angular Command Line Interface, and JDK.
A walkthrough for installing Node & Angular can be found on [Angular's Website](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local).
The walkthrough also contains basic commands you can use to get started on a project.

## Setup

To set up your environment to run this repository locally you will need:
Node.js version 22.9.0
npm version 10.8.3
Angular CLI version 18.2.7

## Running

After cloning or pulling from the repository, ensure that you have all of the necessary packages by navigating to the `fe-app` folder running `npm install`.
After you've installed the necessary packages, you can start the app locally by running `./start` in the `Group16` directory. If you are in VS Code you can open **Run and Debug** pane (`control+shift+d`) and click play.
To visit the app, open your web browser and navigate to the URL `localhost:4200`.
While running, you can enter 'q' in the CLI to quit or 'h' to display a list of options.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on a remote server rented by Cam. On each push to main, a Github action builds both our Angular project and Springboot backend with the Dockerfiles to containers stored in the Github Container Registry. From there, the server's Kubernetes manager, Minikube, pulls down the new container and runs in in 6 different nodes. The routing for the server is configured using Nginx with certificates to allow an HTTPS connection. In RC1, any push to main will also SSH into the server to toggle the K8s pods to rebuild with the new image.

## Testing

Our testing is best done in Visual Studio Code.

- Front End Unit Testing: You must have Chrome installed to run the FE tests. Once installed, run `ng test` in the `/src/fe-app` directory.
- Back End Unit Testing: In the testing pannel hit play on `be` tab under `Java Test`. Unit tests will soon be deployed in RC1 in each PR before merging to main.
- Behavioral Testing: In the command pannel install playwright using `>Install Playwright`. Then start the app locally in the `Group16` directory and run `./start`. Finally run in the testing pannel using the play button.

Our task list is designed to layout all the user's tasks in a simple and clear format, sorted by the closest due date.<br>

Columns from left to right:
- Completed Column
    - Users are able to check off that a task is completed when they choose.
    - Once checked off, the task is moved into a "completed" list, that can be shown when checkbox in the header is selected.
